# horiseon_accessibility_project

## Description

A project assessing the accessibility of a mock website and refactoring existing code.

- This was a challenge of the UNC bootcamp. I was challenged to update an existing site in such a way as to meet accessibility standards.
- I wanted to test ho much I've learned about DRY coding and and see how much I could spot and fix in the existing code.
- I was able to condense a lot of code and learned some cool formatting tricks in the process such as floating boxes.

## Installation
